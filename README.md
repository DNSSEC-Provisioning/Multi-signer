# Multi-Signer

The Multi-signer project is an open project with the goal of providing practical tools and guidelines for the implementation, automation, management and monitoring of a multi-signer model. 

## Multi-signer Project Goals:

- Create and demonstrate tools that automate addition and deletion of signers to a multi-signer model.
- Create monitoring tools to monitor the validity of the zones.
- Create a multi-signer Proof of Concept with multiple organizations.
- Document the use of such tools.
